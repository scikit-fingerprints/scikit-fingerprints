    Split using randomized groups of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds.

    This split uses randomly partitioned groups of Bemis-Murcko molecular scaffolds [1]_
    for splitting. This is a nondeterministic variant of scaffold split, introduced in
    the MoleculeNet [2]_ paper. It aims to verify the model generalization to new scaffolds,
    as an approximation to the time split, while also allowing multiple train-test splits.

    By default, core structure scaffolds are used (following RDKit), which include atom
    types. Original Bemis-Murcko approach uses the cyclic skeleton (CSK) of a molecule,
    replacing all atoms by carbons. It is also known as CSK [3]_, and can be used with
    `use_csk` parameter.

    This approach is known to have certain limitations. In particular, molecules with
    no rings will not get a scaffold, resulting in them being grouped together regardless
    of their structure.

    This variant is nondeterministic, and the scaffolds are randomly shuffled before
    being assigned to subsets (test set is created fist). This approach is also known
    as "balanced scaffold split", and typically leads to more optimistic evaluation than
    regular, deterministic scaffold split [4]_.

    If ``train_size`` and ``test_size`` are integers, they must sum up to the ``data``
    length. If they are floating numbers, they must sum up to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : sequence
        A sequence representing either SMILES strings or RDKit ``Mol`` objects.

    additional_data: sequence
        Additional sequences to be split alongside the main data, e.g. labels.

    train_size : float, default=None
        The fraction of data to be used for the train subset. If None, it is set
        to 1 - test_size. If test_size is also None, it will be set to 0.8.

    test_size : float, default=None
        The fraction of data to be used for the test subset. If None, it is set
        to 1 - train_size. If train_size is also None, it will be set to 0.2.

    use_csk: bool, default=False
        Whether to use the molecule cyclic skeleton (CSK), instead of the core
        structure scaffold.

    return_indices : bool, default=False
        Whether the method should return the input object subsets, i.e. SMILES strings
        or RDKit ``Mol`` objects, or only the indices of the subsets instead of the data.

    random_state: int or NumPy Random Generator instance, default=0
        Seed for random number generator or random state that would be used for
        shuffling the scaffolds.

    Returns
    -------
    subsets : tuple[list, list, ...]
        Tuple with train-test subsets of provided arrays. First two are lists of SMILES
        strings or RDKit ``Mol`` objects, depending on the input type. If `return_indices`
        is True, lists of indices are returned instead of actual data.
