class RuleOfThreeFilter(BaseFilter):
    """
    Rule of three (Ro3).

    Rule optimized to search for fragment-based lead-like compounds with desired properties.
    It was described in [1]_.

    Molecule must fulfill conditions:

    - molecular weight <= 300
    - HBA <= 3
    - HBD <= 3
    - logP <= 3

    Additionally, an extended version of this rule has been proposed, which adds two conditions:

    - number of rotatable bonds <= 3
    - TPSA <= 60

    Parameters
    ----------
    extended : bool, default=False
        Whether to use an extended version of this rule, additionally including TPSA and
        rotatable bonds conditions.

    allow_one_violation : bool, default=False
        Whether to allow violating one of the rules for a molecule. This makes the
        filter less restrictive.

    return_type : {"mol", "indicators", "condition_indicators"}, default="mol"
        What values to return as the filtering result.

        - ``"mol"`` - return a list of molecules remaining in the dataset after filtering
        - ``"indicators"`` - return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass
          the filter (1) and which would be removed (0)
        - ``"condition_indicators"`` - return a Pandas DataFrame with molecules in rows,
          filter conditions in columns, and 0/1 indicators whether a given condition was
          fulfilled by a given molecule

    return_indicators : bool, default=False
        Whether to return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass the
        filter, instead of list of molecules.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            ``return_indicators`` is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
            Use ``return_type`` instead. If ``return_indicators`` is set to ``True``,
            it will take precedence over ``return_type``.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform_x_y` and
        :meth:`transform` are parallelized over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when filtering molecules.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.
