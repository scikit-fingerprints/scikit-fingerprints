class LipinskiFilter(BaseFilter):
    """
    Lipinski's Rule of 5 (RO5).

    Also known as Pfizer's Rule of 5. It evaluates the drug-likeness of a molecule
    as an orally active drug. Assumes that it should be small and lipophilic.
    Description of the rules can be found in the original publication [1]_.

    Molecule can violate at most one of the rules (conditions):

    - molecular weight <= 500
    - HBA <= 10
    - HBD <= 5
    - logP <= 5

    Hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and donors (HBD) use a simplified definition,
    taking into consideration only oxygen and nitrogen bonds with hydrogen (OH, NH).

    Parameters
    ----------
    allow_one_violation : bool, default=True
        Whether to allow violating one of the rules for a molecule. This makes the
        filter less restrictive, and is the part of the original definition of this
        filter.

    return_type : {"mol", "indicators", "condition_indicators"}, default="mol"
        What values to return as the filtering result. `"mol"` returns list of
        molecules passing the filter. `"indicators"` returns a binary vector with
        indicators which molecules pass the filter. `"condition_indicators"` returns
        a Pandas DataFrame with molecules in rows, filter conditions in columns, and
        0/1 indicators whether a given condition was fulfilled by a given molecule.

    return_indicators : bool, default=False
        Whether to return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass the
        filter, instead of list of molecules.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            ``return_indicators`` is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
            Use ``return_type`` instead. If ``return_indicators`` is set to ``True``,
            it will take precedence over ``return_type``.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform_x_y` and
        :meth:`transform` are parallelized over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when filtering molecules.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.
