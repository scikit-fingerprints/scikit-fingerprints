class BMSFilter(BaseSubstructureFilter):
    """
    BMS filter.

    Designed at BMS (Bristol-Myers Squibb) for filtering HTS decks in primary screening.
    Aims to remove molecules containing certain functional groups to filter out random
    noise, “promiscuous” compounds, and frequent hitters.

    Selected functional groups for filtering are divided in the paper into "exclusion
    lists" and "compound annotation". Which ones are "exclusion" filters is not clear
    from the paper, so this is a best-effort approximation from RDKit.

    Rule definitions are available in the supplementary material of the original
    publication [1]_ and in RDKit code [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    allow_one_violation : bool, default=False
        Whether to allow violating one of the rules for a molecule. This makes the
        filter less restrictive.

    return_type : {"mol", "indicators", "condition_indicators"}, default="mol"
        What values to return as the filtering result.

        - ``"mol"`` - return a list of molecules remaining in the dataset after filtering
        - ``"indicators"`` - return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass
          the filter (1) and which would be removed (0)
        - ``"condition_indicators"`` - return a Pandas DataFrame with molecules in rows,
          filter conditions in columns, and 0/1 indicators whether a given condition was
          fulfilled by a given molecule

    return_indicators : bool, default=False
        Whether to return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass the
        filter, instead of list of molecules.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            ``return_indicators`` is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
            Use ``return_type`` instead. If ``return_indicators`` is set to ``True``,
            it will take precedence over ``return_type``.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform_x_y` and
        :meth:`transform` are parallelized over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when filtering molecules.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.
