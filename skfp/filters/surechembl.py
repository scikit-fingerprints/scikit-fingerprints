class SureChEMBLFilter(BaseSubstructureFilter):
    """
    SureChEMBL filter.

    Based on structural alerts, i.e. toxicophores. Filters out compounds likely to be
    toxic. Used at SureChEMBL, and based on the ToxAlerts publication [1]_, so many
    alerts are also found in OChem.

    The original page with rule definitions is available only by the Wayback Machine [2]_.
    They are also available in the RDKit code [3]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    allow_one_violation : bool, default=False
        Whether to allow violating one of the rules for a molecule. This makes the
        filter less restrictive.

    return_type : {"mol", "indicators", "condition_indicators"}, default="mol"
        What values to return as the filtering result.

        - ``"mol"`` - return a list of molecules remaining in the dataset after filtering
        - ``"indicators"`` - return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass
          the filter (1) and which would be removed (0)
        - ``"condition_indicators"`` - return a Pandas DataFrame with molecules in rows,
          filter conditions in columns, and 0/1 indicators whether a given condition was
          fulfilled by a given molecule

    return_indicators : bool, default=False
        Whether to return a binary vector with indicators which molecules pass the
        filter, instead of list of molecules.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            ``return_indicators`` is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
            Use ``return_type`` instead. If ``return_indicators`` is set to ``True``,
            it will take precedence over ``return_type``.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform_x_y` and
        :meth:`transform` are parallelized over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when filtering molecules.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.
