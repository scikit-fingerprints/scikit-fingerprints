class AutocorrFingerprint(BaseFingerprintTransformer):
    """
    Autocorrelation fingerprint.

    The implementation uses RDKit. This is a descriptor-based fingerprint, where
    bits measure strength of autocorrelation of molecular properties between atoms
    with different shortest path distances. For 3D variant, those distances are
    further weighted by Euclidean distance between atoms in a given conformation.

    It uses a hydrogen-depleted molecule, and for each heavy atom computes 6 features:
    atomic mass, van der Waals volume, electronegativity, polarizability, ion polarity,
    and IState [1]_ [2]_. They are then made relative to the carbon, e.g. molecular
    weight is: MW(atom_type) / MW(carbon).

    Four autocorrelation measures are used: Moreau-Broto, centered (average) Moreau-Broto,
    Moran and Geary [3]_ [4]_. They are calculated using topological distances (shortest
    paths), with distance between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This results in 192 features:
    6 atom features * 4 autocorrelations * 8 distances.

    3D variant has the following differences:

    - requires passing molecules with conformers and `conf_id` integer property set
    - weights topological distances by Euclidean distance between atoms
    - uses 2 additional features: constant 1 (which measures Euclidean distance
      autocorrelation due to weighting) and covalent radius (RCov)
    - uses shortest paths distances between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
    - uses only Moreau-Broto autocrrelation
    - results in 80 features: 8 atom features * 10 distances

    Parameters
    ----------
    use_3D : bool, default=False
        Whether to use 3D Euclidean distance matrix. If False, only uses topological
        distances on molecular graph.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform` is parallelized
        over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1 unless in a
        :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all processors.
        See Scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when computing fingerprints.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_out : int = 192 or 80
        Number of output features. Equal to 192 for 2D and 80 for 3D, which depends
        on the ``use_3D`` parameter.

    requires_conformers : bool
        Whether the fingerprint is 3D-based and requires molecules with conformers as
        inputs, with ``conf_id`` integer property set. This depends on the ``use_3D``
        parameter, and has the same value.
