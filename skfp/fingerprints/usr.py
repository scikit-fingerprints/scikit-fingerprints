class USRFingerprint(BaseFingerprintTransformer):
    """
    USR (Ultrafast Shape Recognition) fingerprint.

    The implementation uses RDKit. This is a descriptor-based fingerprint, which
    characterizes the shape of the molecule by encoding the relative positions of its
    atoms [1]_ [2]_.

    Four points are considered: molecular centroid (ctd), the closest atom to centroid (cst),
    the farthest atom from centroid (fct), and atom the fartest from fct (ftf). Distances
    from all atoms to each of those four points are computed, and each of those distributions
    is summarized its first three moments: mean, variance, and skewness. Concretely, standard
    deviation and cubic root of skewness are used to keep the same unit. This results in
    12 descriptors.

    This is a 3D fingerprint, and requires molecules with ``conf_id`` integer property
    set. They can be generated with :class:`~skfp.preprocessing.ConformerGenerator`.
    Furthermore, only molecules with 3 or more atoms are allowed, to allow computation
    of all three moments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    errors : {"raise", "NaN", "ignore"}, default="raise"
        How to handle errors during fingerprint calculation. ``"raise"`` immediately
        raises any errors. ``"NaN"`` returns NaN values for molecules which resulted in
        errors. ``"ignore"`` suppresses errors and does not return anything for
        molecules with errors. This potentially results in fewer output vectors than
        input molecules, and should be used with caution.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform` is parallelized
        over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1 unless in a
        :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all processors.
        See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        Number of inputs processed in each batch. ``None`` divides input data into
        equal-sized parts, as many as ``n_jobs``.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when computing fingerprints.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_out : int = 12
        Number of output features, size of fingerprints.

    requires_conformers : bool = True
        Value is always True, as this fingerprint is 3D based. It always requires
        molecules with conformers as inputs, with ``conf_id`` integer property set.

        atom types.

        partial charges.
