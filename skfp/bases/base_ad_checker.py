class BaseADChecker(ABC, BaseEstimator, OutlierMixin):
    """
    Base class for checking applicability domain.

    Applicability Domain (AD) checkers take a list of training molecules and
    model the bounds of their chemical space. For new molecules, they check
    if they lie near the training data, i.e. in the applicability domain
    of the dataset.

    This is very similar to outlier detection, and such methods from e.g.
    scikit-learn can also be applied here. However, here 0 denotes an outlier
    (outside AD), and 1 means inside AD (inlier). This differs slightly from
    scikit-learn, which uses -1 for outliers, but results in easier filtering.

    This class is not meant to be used directly. If you want to create custom
    applicability domain checkers, inherit from this class and override methods:

    - ``.fit()` - learns the chemical space bounds, e.g. calculates statistics
      saved as object attributes
    - ``.predict()` - checks if molecules are in AD or not, and outputs a vector
      of booleans (True - in AD)
    - ``.score_samples()` - applicability domain score of molecules

    Note that score nature depends on the particular method. In some cases it is
    straight AD score (larger = better), which measures how firmly a molecule lies
    inside applicability domain. For other methods this is an outlier score (lower =
    better), which checks how far a new sample is from training data.

    Sparse arrays are not supported, as most methods rely on inherently dense
    physicochemical descriptors and also do not scale well with number of features.
    High-dimensional spaces also tend to break down AD checking methods due to curse
    of dimensionality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`transform_x_y` and
        :meth:`transform` are parallelized over the input molecules. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See scikit-learn documentation on ``n_jobs`` for more details.

    verbose : int or dict, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when computing applicability domain statistics.
        If a dictionary is passed, it is treated as kwargs for ``tqdm()``,
        and can be used to control the progress bar.
