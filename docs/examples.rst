Examples
========

Here you can learn about scikit-fingerprints and molecular fingerprints in general
with practical examples. All are available as Jupyter Notebooks
`on GitHub <https://github.com/scikit-fingerprints/scikit-fingerprints/tree/master/examples>`_.

If you are completely new to molecular ML and molecular fingerprints, you may be also
interested in `our molecular ML workshops <https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops>`_.
They introduce RDKit, scikit-fingerprints and their applications from the ground up.
