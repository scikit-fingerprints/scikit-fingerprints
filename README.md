## Description

Molecular fingerprints are crucial in various scientific fields, including drug discovery, materials science, and
chemical analysis. However, existing Python libraries for computing molecular fingerprints often lack performance,
user-friendliness, and support for modern programming standards. This project aims to address these shortcomings by
creating an efficient and accessible Python library for molecular fingerprint computation.

You can find the documentation [HERE](https://scikit-fingerprints.github.io/scikit-fingerprints/)

- The library offers various functions that accept molecule descriptors (e.g., SMILES) and fingerprint parameters,
  returning the specified fingerprints.
- It's open-source and available for installation via pip.
- The library has been designed for ease of use, minimizing the need for extensive training.
- Compatibility with the standard Python ML stack, based on scikit-learn interfaces, has been a top priority.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-fingerprints
```

## Basic Usage
```python
from skfp.fingerprints import AtomPairFingerprint

smiles_list = ['O=S(=O)(O)CCS(=O)(=O)O', 'O=C(O)c1ccccc1O']

atom_pair_fingerprint = AtomPairFingerprint()
X_skfp = atom_pair_fingerprint.transform(smiles_list)

print(X_skfp)
```

## General Project Vision

The primary goal of this project was to develop a Python library that simplifies the computation of widely-used
molecular fingerprints, such as Morgan's fingerprint, MACCS fingerprint, and others. This library has the following key
features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The library was designed to provide an intuitive interface, making it easy to integrate
  into machine learning workflows.

- **Performance Optimization:** We implemented molecular fingerprint computation algorithms using concurrent programming
  techniques to maximize performance. Large datasets of molecules are processed in parallel for improved efficiency.

- **Compatibility:** The library's interface was inspired by popular data science libraries like Scikit-Learn, ensuring
  compatibility and familiarity for users familiar with these tools.

- **Extensibility:** Users should be able to customize and extend the library to suit their specific needs.
