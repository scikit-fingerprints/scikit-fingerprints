    "# MinMax clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "MinMax clustering is a centroid-based clustering method designed for binary molecular fingerprints. It combines diversity-based centroid selection with similarity-based cluster assignment, making it particularly suitable for partitioning chemical space into representative regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many classical clustering algorithms, MinMax clustering explicitly selects cluster centers to maximize diversity before assigning molecules to clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm overview\n",
    "\n",
    "MinMax clustering proceeds in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centroid selection (MaxMin diversity picking)**\n",
    "A set of representative molecules is selected using RDKit’s MaxMinPicker. Centroids are chosen iteratively such that each newly selected centroid maximizes the minimum Tanimoto distance to all previously selected centroids. This encourages broad coverage of chemical space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cluster assignment**\n",
    "Once centroids are fixed, all molecules (including the centroids themselves) are assigned to the nearest centroid using Tanimoto similarity. Each molecule is assigned to the cluster corresponding to the centroid with the highest similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance and similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "MinMax clustering operates on binary fingerprints and uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Tanimoto similarity* to measure molecular similarity\n",
    "- *Tanimoto distance* (1 − similarity) during centroid selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice is standard in cheminformatics and well suited for sparse binary representations such as ECFP (Morgan) fingerprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlling cluster granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The number and spread of clusters are controlled by the distance threshold used during centroid selection:\n",
    "- **Lower thresholds** produce fewer, broader clusters\n",
    "- **Higher thresholds** produce more, finer-grained clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact number of clusters emerges from the data and the chosen threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm does not balance cluster sizes or select fixed-size subsets; such operations are left to downstream processing."
