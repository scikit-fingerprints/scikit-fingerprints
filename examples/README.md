# Examples

This directory contains examples and short tutorials about `scikit-fingerprints`,
in a form  of Jupyter Notebooks.

If you want to learn step by step, read notebooks in order. However,  they are
written to be relatively self-contained, so you can jump in at whatever stage is
useful for you.

### Setup

All notebooks require `scikit-fingerprints` to be installed in your environment. If
a particular notebook requires any additional dependencies, they are explicitly
mentioned.
